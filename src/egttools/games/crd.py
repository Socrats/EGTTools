#         This class implements a One-Shot Collective Risk Dilemma.
#
#         This N-player game was first introduced in "Santos, F. C., & Pacheco, J. M. (2011).
#         Risk of collective failure provides an escape from the tragedy of the commons.
#         Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108(26), 10421â€“10425.".
#
#         The game consists of a group of size ``group_size`` (N) which can be composed of
#         Cooperators (Cs) who will contribute a fraction ``cost`` (c) of their
#         :param endowment (b) to the public good. And of Defectors (Ds) who contribute 0.
#
#         If the total contribution of the group is equal or surpasses the collective target Mcb,
#         with M being the ``min_nb_cooperators``, then all participants will receive as payoff
#         their remaining endowment. Which is, Cs receive b - cb and Ds receive b. Otherwise, all
#         participants receive 0 endowment with a probability equal to ``risk`` (r), and will
#         keep their endowment with probability 1-r. This means that each group must have at least
#         M Cs for the collective target to be achieved.
#
#         Parameters
#         ----------
#         endowment : float
#             The initial endowment (b) received by all participants
#         cost : float
#             The fraction of the endowment that Cooperators contribute to the public good.
#             This value must be in the interval [0, 1]
#         risk : float
#             The risk that all members of the group will lose their remaining endowment if the
#             collective target is not achieved.
#         group_size : int
#             The size of the group (N)
#         min_nb_cooperators : int
#             The minimum number of cooperators (M) required to reach the collective target.
#             In other words, the collective target is reached if the collective effort is
#             at least Mcb. This value must be in the discrete interval [[0, N]].
