class AbstractNPlayerGameExpectedPayoff(AbstractNPlayerGame):
    """
    This abstract Game class can be used in most scenarios where the fitness of a strategy is calculated as its
    expected payoff given the population state.

    It assumes that the game is N player, since the fitness of a strategy given a population state is calculated
    as the expected payoff of that strategy over all possible group combinations in the given state.

    Notes
    -----
    It might be a good idea to overwrite the methods `__str__`, `type`, and `save_payoffs` to adapt to your
    given game implementation

    It assumes that you have at least the following attributes:
     1. And an attribute `self.nb_strategies_` which contains the number of strategies
     that you are going to analyse for the given game.
     2. `self.payoffs()` returns a numpy.ndarray and contain the payoff matrix of the game. This array
     is of shape (self.nb_strategies(), self.nb_group_configurations()), where self.nb_group_configurations()
     is the number
     of possible combinations of strategies in the group. Thus, each row should give the (expected) payoff of the row
     strategy when playing in a group with the column configuration. The `payoff` method provides an easy way to access
     the payoffs for any group composition, by taking as arguments the index of the row strategy
     and a List with the count of each possible strategy in the group.

     You must still implement the methods `play` which should define how the game assigns
     payoffs to each strategy for a given game context. In particular, `calculate_payoffs` should fill the
     array `self.payoffs_` with the correct values as explained above. We recommend that you run this method in
     the `__init__` (initialization of the object) since, these values must be set before passing the game object
     to the numerical simulator (e.g., egttools.numerical.PairwiseMoran).

    This abstract Game class can be used in most scenarios where the fitness of a strategy is calculated as its

    For normal form games:
    1. There is already a class called NormalFormGame available which you can use for these types of games. If
    for any reason this does not cover your needs then:
    2. If your game is normal form, but iterated, you should create another variable to contain the payoff matrix
    for one round of the game, since `self.payoffs_` will contain the expected payoffs over the several rounds
    of the game.
    3. If the game is one-shot and normal form, `self.payoffs_` is the payoff matrix of the game, and you do not
    need to do anything in calculate_payoffs besides calling this matrix.
