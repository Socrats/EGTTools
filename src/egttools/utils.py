    the Small Mutation Limit (SML) of the Pairwise Moran Process. In this case, we do not need to
    know the payoffs for each strategy for any group composition (i.e., when there are more than
    2 strategies in the group), but only for all possible combinations of each 2 strategies.

    entry of the matrix a function, which will return the payoff of the strategy given k players
