**EGTtools** provides a centralized repository with analytical 
and numerical methods to study/model game theoretical problems under the Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) framework.

This library is implemented both in Python and C++ (with Python bindings) in order to
provide optimized computational methods that can run in parallel in a reasonable time.

To install all required packages run:

```bash
python -m venv egtenv
source egtenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with anaconda:

```bash
conda create --name egtenv
conda activate egtenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, to make your virtual environment visible to jupyter:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=egtenv
```

The [EGTtools](egttools/analytical/sed_analytical.py) module contains classes and functions that you may use to investigate the evolutionary dynamics in 2-player games.

The [Example](docs/examples/hawk_dove_dynamics.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook the analysis of the evolutionary dynamics in a Hawk-Dove game.
