         * @brief This class implements a One-Shot Collective Risk Dilemma on networks.
         *
         *  This N-player game was first introduced in "Santos, F. C., & Pacheco, J. M. (2011).
         *  Risk of collective failure provides an escape from the tragedy of the commons.
         *  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108(26), 10421â€“10425.".*
         *
         *  The game consists of a group of size ``group_size`` (N) which can be composed of
         *  Cooperators (Cs) who will contribute a fraction ``cost`` (c) of their
         *  ``endowment`` (b) to the public good. And of Defectors (Ds) who contribute 0.
         *
         *  If the total contribution of the group is equal or surpasses the collective target Mcb,
         *  with M being the ``min_nb_cooperators``, then all participants will receive as payoff
         *  their remaining endowment. Which is, Cs receive b - cb and Ds receive b. Otherwise, all
         *  participants receive 0 endowment with a probability equal to ``risk`` (r), and will
         *  keep their endowment with probability 1-r. This means that each group must have at least
         *  M Cs for the collective target to be achieved.
         *
         * @param endowment : The initial endowment (b) received by all participants
         * @param cost : The fraction of the endowment that Cooperators contribute to the public good.
         *               This value must be in the interval [0, 1]
         * @param risk : The risk that all members of the group will lose their remaining endowment if the
         *               collective target is not achieved.
         * @param min_nb_cooperators : The minimum number of cooperators (M) required to reach the
         *                             collective target. In other words, the collective target is
         *                             reached if the collective effort is at least Mcb. This value
         *                             must be in the discrete interval [[0, N]].
