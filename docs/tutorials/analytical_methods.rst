The replicator dynamics
-----------------------

.. note::
    For the moment `egttools` only supports the use of the replicator
    dynamics with 2-player games. We have planned to add support for
    N-player games in version 0.13.0.


Stochastic dynamics in finite populations: the pairwise comparison rule
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    Currently, `egttools` only implements the moran process with the pairwise
    comparison rule. However, we have planned to add other evolutionary game
    theoretical models soon, such as the frequency dependant moran process or the
    Wright-Fisher process.

.. note::
    We will add support for multiple populations soon.
