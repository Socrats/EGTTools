EGTtools -- Toolbox for Evolutionary Game Theory
================================================

**EGTtools** provides a centralized repository with analytical
and numerical methods to study/model game theoretical problems under the Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) framework.

This library is implemented both in Python and C++ (with Python bindings) in order to
provide optimized computational methods that can run in parallel in a reasonable time.
