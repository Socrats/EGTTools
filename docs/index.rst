EGTtools -- Toolbox for Evolutionary Game Theory
================================================

**EGTtools** provides a centralized repository with analytical and numerical methods to study/model game theoretical
problems under the Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) framework.

This library is composed of two parts:

- a set of analytical methods implemented in Python 3
- a set of computational methods implemented in C++ with (Python 3 bindings)

The second typed is used in cases where the state space is too big to solve analytically, and thus require estimating
the model parameters through monte-carlo simulations. The C++ implementation provides optimized computational methods
that can run in parallel in a reasonable time, while Python bindings make the methods easily accecible to a larger range
of researchers.
